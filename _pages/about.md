I am currently an M.S. student advised by Prof. [Taehwan Kim](https://sites.google.com/view/taehwankim), in [IMML lab](https://sites.google.com/view/mvllab/home?authuser=0) at [UNIST AIGS](https://aigs.unist.ac.kr/). Previously, I received my B.S. in Computer Science Engineering from [Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology (UNIST)](https://www.unist.ac.kr/).

My research aims to develop effective machine learning methods in multimodal representation spaces. I am passionate about advancing scientific knowledge by leveraging multimodal data to build AI systems with deeper and more robust understanding.
