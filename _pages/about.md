I am currently a M.S. student advised by Prof. [Taehwan Kim](https://sites.google.com/view/taehwankim), in [IMML lab](https://sites.google.com/view/mvllab/home?authuser=0) at [UNIST AIGS](https://aigs.unist.ac.kr/). Previously, I obtained my B.S. degree from [Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology (UNIST)](https://www.unist.ac.kr/) in Computer Science Engineering.

My research aims to develop efficient machine learning methods in multimodal contrastive representations. I am passionate about innovative applications and techniques related to offering familarity of AI usage for people, and advancing scientific knowledge.
