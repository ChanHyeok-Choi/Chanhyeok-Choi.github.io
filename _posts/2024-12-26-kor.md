## Korean Version

- ### Deep Reinforcement Learning

  I highly recommend the **Deep Reinforcement Learning** lectures by Prof. Sung Kim, available on the  
  [Everyone's Deep Learning](https://hunkim.github.io/ml/) website.  
  The lectures are in Korean, each about 15 minutes long, and can be completed in a single day.  
  The series starts from the basics of Q-learning and builds up to DQN, explaining the motivation and algorithmic workflow in a very intuitive way.

  These lectures were extremely helpful for building a solid foundation in reinforcement learning.

- ### Auto Encoder

  Dr. Hwal Seok Lee’s video series, *Everything About Autoencoders*  
  ([YouTube link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_peo6U7IRM)), provides a detailed, 3-part introduction to **Autoencoders**, one of the fundamental generative models.

  Since the lectures include some mathematical formulations early on, I recommend them to those who already have basic knowledge of deep learning and generative models. They were very helpful in understanding the overall structure and intuition behind autoencoders.

## English Version

- ### Deep Unsupervised Learning

  I strongly recommend UC Berkeley Prof. Pieter Abbeel’s  
  **Deep Unsupervised Learning** course  
  ([course website](https://sites.google.com/view/berkeley-cs294-158-sp24/home)).  
  You can watch the lectures via this  
  [YouTube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFR6Likf4VI&list=PLwRJQ4m4UJjPIvv4kgBkvu_uygrV3ut_U&index=2).  
  It is a gem of a course that covers a wide range of generative models and provides insights into recent trends in the field.

- ### Deep Learning in Computer Vision

  A widely acclaimed course from Stanford University,  
  **CS231n: Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition**, offers comprehensive material on applying deep learning to computer vision.  
  All resources are available on the official website:  
  <https://cs231n.stanford.edu/>  
  The course provides excellent intuition and practical understanding of CV workflows. Since the programming assignments are publicly available, I highly recommend trying them out in Colab for hands-on experience.
